PURPOSE OF THE EXERCISE:
How to calculate EOS (equation-of-state) of a cubic system using the
EOS utility of PWTK.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example we calculated the EOS of Rh bulk. To run the example,
execute:

   pwtk eos.Rh-bulk.pwtk >& eos.Rh-bulk.log &

Read the resulting eos.Rh-bulk.log file, it is instructive. In
addition to this log file the EOS final results are also written to
file eos.Al-bulk.RESULTS.

Notice from the results, how much more sensitive the bulk-modulus is
to the sampling of points than the lattice-parameter and equilibrium
total energy. Do you know why?
