PURPOSE OF THE EXERCISE:
How to run many calculations with a relatively simple PWTK script.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The subject of this example is the calculation of a 2D potential
energy scan of lateral positions of O @ Al(111). It introduces the
PWTK's concept of input-data stacking (i.e. "input_pushpop { ... }").

For further explanation, see the comments within the PWTK "scan.pwtk"x
script. To run the whole example, execute:

   pwtk scan.pwtk >& scan.log &

BEWARE: this example takes quite long. 
TODO: consider to change this example as to run on the cluster !!!

The resulting potential-energy-surface can be visualized as:

   gnuplot plot2D.gp
